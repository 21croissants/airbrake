HoptoadNotifier
===============

This is the notifier plugin for integrating apps with Hoptoad.

When an uncaught exception occurs, HoptoadNotifier will POST the relevant data 
to the Hoptoad server specified in your environment.


INSTALLATION

From your project's RAILS_ROOT, run:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/thoughtbot/hoptoad_notifier.git

CONFIGURATION

You should have something like this in your environment.rb file (or 
config/initializers/hoptoad.rb in rails 2).

  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = '1234567890abcdef'
  end
  
Then, to enable hoptoad in your appication, include this code...

  include HoptoadNotifier::Catcher

...at the top of your ApplicationController, and all exceptions will be logged 
to Hoptoad where they can be aggregated, filtered, sorted, analyzed, massaged 
and searched.

You can test that hoptoad is working in your production environment by using 
this rake task (from RAILS_ROOT):

  rake hoptoad:test RAILS_ENV=production

If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice to hoptoad 
which will be visible immediately. Note that your app must be able to run in
production mode for this rake task to work, so it's quite possible that you can't
run it from your development environment. Due to the way the exception handling
works, this test can't be run from the development environment.
