HoptoadNotifier
===============

This is the notifier plugin for integrating apps with Hoptoad. When an
uncaught exception occurs, HoptoadNotifier will POST the relevant data
to the Hoptoad server specified in your environment.rb

  HoptoadNotifier.url      = "http://192.168.1.33:3000/notices/"
  HoptoadNotifier.app_name = "my_sweet_app"
  
Then make sure you have

  include HoptoadNotifier::Catcher

in your ApplicationController, and all exceptions will be logged to Hoptoad
where they can be aggregated, filtered, and searched.
