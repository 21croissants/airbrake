HoptoadNotifier
===============

This is the notifier plugin for integrating apps with Hoptoad.

When an uncaught exception occurs, HoptoadNotifier will POST 
the relevant data to the Hoptoad server specified in your environment.

You should have something like this in your environment.rb file 
(or config/initializers/hoptoad.rb in rails 2).

  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.host         = 'hoptoad.thoughtbot.com'
    config.port         = 80
    config.project_name = 'my fancy application'
  end
  
Then, to enable hoptoad in your appication, include this code:

  include HoptoadNotifier::Catcher

in your ApplicationController, and all exceptions will be logged 
to Hoptoad where they can be aggregated, filtered, sorted, 
analyzed, massaged and searched.

You can test that hoptoad is working in your production environment 
by using this rake task (from RAILS_ROOT):

	rake hoptoad:test RAILS_ENV=production

If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice 
to hoptoad which will be visible immediately.
