HoptoadNotifier
===============

This is the notifier plugin for integrating apps with Hoptoad. When an
uncaught exception occurs, HoptoadNotifier will POST the relevant data
to the Hoptoad server specified in your environment.rb

  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.host         = "hoptoad.thoughtbot.com"
    config.port         = 80
    config.project_name = "my sweet app"
  end
  
Then make sure you have

  include HoptoadNotifier::Catcher

in your ApplicationController, and all exceptions will be logged to Hoptoad
where they can be aggregated, filtered, and searched.
