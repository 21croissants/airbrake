HoptoadNotifier
===============

This is the notifier plugin for integrating apps with Hoptoad.

When an uncaught exception occurs, HoptoadNotifier will POST the relevant data 
to the Hoptoad server specified in your environment.


INSTALLATION

From your project's RAILS_ROOT, run (for svn):

  piston import https://svn.thoughtbot.com/plugins/hoptoad_notifier/trunk vendor/plugins/hoptoad_notifier

Or for git:

 script/plugin install git://github.com/thoughtbot/hoptoad_notifier.git
  

CONFIGURATION

You should have something like this in your environment.rb file (or 
config/initializers/hoptoad.rb in rails 2).

  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.port         = 80
    config.api_key      = '1234567890abcdef'
    config.ignore       << ActiveRecord::IgnoreThisError
  end
  
Then, to enable hoptoad in your appication, include this code...

  include HoptoadNotifier::Catcher

...at the top of your ApplicationController, and all exceptions will be logged 
to Hoptoad where they can be aggregated, filtered, sorted, analyzed, massaged 
and searched.

You can test that hoptoad is working in your production environment by using 
this rake task (from RAILS_ROOT):

  rake hoptoad:test RAILS_ENV=production

If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice to hoptoad 
which will be visible immediately.
